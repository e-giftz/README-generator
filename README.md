## Description
This is a Node.js application that quickly and easily generates a professional README.md file from the user's input using the inquirer package. 
The code provides a clean, polished and interactive CLI that prompts the user for information and uses these data to generate the README.md file.

The application is invoked at the root of the project using the command line when the user types the following command: ```node index.js```<br />
Press enter  to run the command entered above; then the user is  presented with question prompts.Answer each question presented as best as you can and press enter at every step to submit answers.

At the end of the question prompts when the user has answered all questions, the README.md file is automatically generated and a success message is displayed.
The newly generated README.md file is found in the Develop folder [here](Develop/README.md).

If the user enters the license for this application, then the badge is created and added to the new README.md file and if the user leaves  the license field blank, then no badge or license is listed on the new README.md file.
